## Branch Naming

Branches need to follow a naming pattern based on the type of branch being created:
- `feature/MINT-####_description` should be used when developing a feature branch that will have multiple other branches merged into it. Feature branches should merge directly into `main`.
  - `MINT-####` is a the Jira issue number for the parent issue/story
  - `description` is a short description of the feature being developed
- `task/MINT-####_description` should be used when developing a task branch that will be merged into a feature branch. Task branches should merge into the feature branch they are associated with.
  - `MINT-####` is a the Jira issue number for the *parent* Jira issue, *NOT* the child issue.
  - `description` is a short description of the work
- `MINT-####/description` should be used for any other branch that is not a feature or task branch. The most common case for this pattern will be an issue in Jira that doesn't have any parent or child issues (e.g. a bugfix). These branches should merge directly into `main`.
  - `MINT-####` is a the Jira issue number for the related Jira issue.
  - `description` is a short description of the work being completed in this branch
- `NOREF/description` should be used for any branch that is not associated with a Jira issue. These branches should merge directly into `main`.
  - This should only be used in rare cases where a branch is needed for a change that is not associated with a Jira issue.

### Example

Let's say we're developing a new feature to add animations to the homepage. The Jira issue for this feature is `MINT-1234`. You could expect to see the following branches and PRs throughout the development of this feature:
- `feature/MINT-1234_add-homepage-animations`, which PRs into `main`
	- `task/MINT-1234_add_login_animation`, which PRs into `feature/MINT-1234_add-homepage-animations`
	- `task/MINT-1234_add_loading_animation`, which PRs into `feature/MINT-1234_add-homepage-animations`
	- `task/MINT-1234_fix_cypress_tests`, which PRs into `feature/MINT-1234_add-homepage-animations`
