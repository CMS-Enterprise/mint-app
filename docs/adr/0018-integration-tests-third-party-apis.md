# Mock third-party APIs in CI/CD integration tests

**User Story:** [EASi 688](https://jiraent.cms.gov/browse/EASI-688)

When running integration tests in our CI environment, how will EASi test the
calls to third-party APIs? Will those API calls be mocked or will they hit the
live APIs? The main driver behind this ADR is CEDAR integration tests, and a
desire to sufficiently test EASI-CEDAR integration while providing fast feedback
in CI. Okta tests are out of scope.

In this context, "integration test" refers to either: (1) a Cypress test
(frontend/backend integration/end-to-end test); or (2) the backend [integration
tests](https://github.com/CMSgov/easi-app/tree/master/pkg/integration) that run
when invoking `easi test`. "CI environment" means the network in which our
CircleCI containers run. "Deployed environment" means one of our AWS
environments (development, implementation, production). The term "mock" is being
used loosely here, and is meant to be inclusive of other testing terms such as
stub, fake, spy, etc.

## Considered Alternatives

* Do not mock the API calls
* Mock the API calls

## Decision Outcome

* Chosen Alternative: Mock the API calls, as this will speed up the tests and
  reduce operational and networking overhead from the CI environment.  Since a
  successful deployment to the development AWS environment is required before
  merging code, we can use the [health
  check](https://github.com/CMSgov/easi-app/blob/master/pkg/server/health_check.go)
  that runs on server start in a deployed environment as a test to prevent
  breaking changes to the CEDAR API client from being merged.

## Pros and Cons of the Alternatives <!-- optional -->

### Do not mock the API calls

* `+` Tests the code as it will run in deployed environments
* `+` Eliminates need to write additional mock code
* `-` Tests take longer to run
* `-` Sending and storing the same test data to the third-party API in each test
  run would likely require a solution to clear out or reset the test data before
  each test run
* `-` Adds traffic load on the third-party API
* `-` Adds networking dependencies to the CI test environment

### Mock the API calls

* `+` Health check tests that run on server startup in deployed environments
  already test that the deployed environment is successfully integrated with the
  external API
* `+` Tests run faster
* `+` Tests would run in a clean environment on each run; no extra steps needed
  to delete previous test data
* `+` Tests are focused on code that we control
* `+` Follows a design-by-contract methodology
* `+` Removes networking dependencies from the CI test environment
* `+` Reduces traffic load on the third-party API
* `-` Tests do not fully match the code as it will run in deployed environments
* `-` Requires writing additional mock code
