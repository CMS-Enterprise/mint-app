# Persistance Layer Planning

[EASI - 1700](https://jiraent.cms.gov/browse/EASI-1700)

As we begin to develop MINT as a new application based on EASi, we need to evaluate the persistence layer needs.

*Questions this Spike Should Answer*
 * What kind of persistence layer makes sense for the CMMI work?
 ** Relational Database?
 ** Document Store / NoSQL?
 * What kinds of data are we going to be storing?Â 
 * Is there value in stored procedures over inline SQL for a relational database?
 * Do we need anything else on top of a relational data store?
 * Are there any areas that caching solutions might be helpful?

## Considered Alternatives

* *[alternative 1]*
* *[alternative 2]*
* *[alternative 3]*
* *[...]* <!-- numbers of alternatives can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

* Chosen Alternative: *[alternative 1]*
* *[justification.
  e.g., only alternative,
  which meets KO criterion decision driver
  | which resolves force force
  | ...
  | comes out best (see below)]*
* *[consequences. e.g.,
  negative impact on quality attribute,
  follow-up decisions required,
  ...]* <!-- optional -->

## Pros and Cons of the Alternatives <!-- optional -->

### *[alternative 1]*

* `+` *[argument 1 pro]*
* `+` *[argument 2 pro]*

### *[alternative 3]*

* `+` *[argument 1 pro]*
* `+` *[argument 2 pro]*
