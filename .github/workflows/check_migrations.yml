name: Check Migrations

# This workflow validates database migrations by:
# 1. Checking for duplicate migration version numbers
# 2. Ensuring new migrations are consecutive
# 3. Preventing modification or deletion of existing migrations (PRs only)

on:
  pull_request:
    # Run on all PRs - the script exits gracefully if no migrations changed
    # This allows the check to be required without blocking non-migration PRs
  
  # Run on merge queue events - GitHub Enterprise feature
  merge_group:
    # This runs when PR enters the merge queue
    # Tests PR against the queue's temporary branch
    # Automatically prevents race conditions!
    # Note: merge_group doesn't support paths filter, so this runs for all PRs in the queue
  
  # Also run on push to main/master to catch any issues that slip through
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master

# CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
# 
# Settings → Branches → Enable "Require merge queue"
# - Automatically serializes merges
# - Runs this check in queue against latest base
# - No manual rebasing needed!
#

# Concurrency strategy:
# - For PRs: Allow parallel validation (each checks against base branch)
# - For merges to main: Serialize to prevent race conditions
concurrency:
  # Use different concurrency groups for PRs vs merges
  group: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && 'migration-merge-lock' || format('check-migrations-{0}', github.ref) }}
