# This GitHub action checks for duplicate migration prefixes in the ./migrations folder,
# comparing the head branch with the base branch.
#
# This job also checks to ensure that migrations are only ever added to the ./migrations folder, and not removed or modified.
#
# By default, on: pull request targets the merge commit, which is the commit that would be merged into the base branch,
# meaning it will include commits from the head branch and the base branch (allowing us to check for version conflicts)
