## PR Reviewer Guidelines
<!--
This is just some static content to ensure we're following best practices when reviewing.
There is no need to edit this section.
-->
- It's best to pull the branch locally and test it, rather than just looking at the code online!
- When approving a PR, provide a reason _why_ you're approving it
  - e.g. "Approving because I tested it locally and all functionality works as expected"
  - e.g. "Approving because the change is simple and matches the Figma design"
- Don't be afraid to leave comments or ask questions, especially if you don't understand why something was done! (This is often a great time to suggest code comments or documentation updates)
- Check that all code is adequately covered by tests - if it isn't feel free to suggest the addition of tests.
