        Timelines can vary depending on model team’s use of 4i and ACO-OS features. Onboarding to the 4i platform can take 10-12 weeks depending on the features and prioritization by the model teams, provided there are no major changes or customizations. Additionally, any policy or legislation changes can potentially result in a delay to the application go-live dates.

            Begin onboarding activities
          </h3>
          Provide CBOSC with as much information about your model as you know by filling out their onboarding questionnaire. They’ll set up a discovery meeting with your team to identify any missing information and let you know what services CBOSC can provide to your model. During this time, CBOSC will form an internal onboarding team. They develop an onboarding timeline that assures readiness.

          >
            Resource mailbox creation
          </h3>
          If the model needs a mailbox, they should infrom CBOSC and provide a list of names and email addresses that should have access the mailbox. Any folders, auto reply messages, and templates are also set up.
        </li>

          >
            Confirm final helpdesk requirements
          </h3>
          CBOS will review and confirm the needs of the model. If the model intends to use phone, the call center must also evaluate interactive voice response (IVR) option tree at this phase.

          >
            Build out IVR and test
          </h3>
          During this stage, they will create routing, record model specific messages, update reports and test. CBOSC will then provide the call center phone number and IVR option. Model teams must communicate and update all appropriate stakeholders of the new numbers.

            Conduct support center / helpdesk training
          </h3>
          The Help Desk Manager works with the Model Lead to review training materials. These will include any prepared materials, knowledge base articles, or other items. Each level of the support center will receive training.

            ServiceNow (SNow) set up and training
          </h3>
          During this phase, the model team receives the appropriate job codes and training for SNow. Knowledge base content is developed and published, and agents are trained on the content.

            Development and validation

          All models will need submission and validation templates to be built and tested prior to the first data submission. Any model requirements not met by HDR’s current functionality will also need built. This will take extra time, so please plan accordingly.

If the model will use HDR’s pre-fill option, the model team’s implementation contractor will need to provide the following:

        The ISP systems (CDX, HDR, eDFR, and Model Space) vary in functionality. Therefore, onboarding and implementation times for the three systems vary. However, the onboarding typically takes months rather than years depending on capacity.

          Model team management should reach out to Ann Vrabel and Melanie Dang to get an official LV team member assigned to assist with their legal needs.

However, if the team management does not know whether or not they will need an LV PA drafter, then a separate request can be made later.

        The CMMI MIDS contract is currently in option year 3 of a base plus 4-year contract. Most of the quality measure work has already been identified and approved for the current year, however, you can still consider the CMMI MIDS contract for ad hoc analyses or reports to support the design of the quality strategy for model work. The CMMI MIDS contract has one more year remaining, option year 4, then the contract will be recompeted. The timeline for developing and supporting a new quality measure varies based on the complexity of the measure. The CMMI MIDS contractor will work with the model teams to develop and maintain their quality measures during the models’ lifecycle.

            Reach out to Quality Vertical
          </h3>
          Model teams interested in utilizing the CMMI MIDS contract for quality measure work should email the Quality Vertical Program Analyst, Dustin Allison. Dustin is responsible for the review and consideration of all quality measure requests being considered for the CMMI MIDS contract. The email should include a brief overview of what the model is, justification for the measure work, and also identify available funding to pay for this work. Dustin will meet with the QV team to review the request and determine if the work should move forward. If the request is approved, the model teams will reach out to the CMMI MIDS COR to move forward with their request.

            COR meets with the model team
          </h3>
          Once model teams receive approval from Dustin to utilize the CMMI MIDS contract, they should then reach out to the CMMI MIDS COR, Teresa Winder-Wells, and the CMMI MIDS Quality Subject Matter Expert (QSME), Tim Day to discuss their quality measure needs. Teresa and Tim will guide the model teams as they prepare justification to present their request to the Front Office (FO).

          </h3>
          The model teams will present their justification to the FO. The FO will determine if they want to move forward with the model team’s request and if additional funding is needed. If approval is given, the model teams will reach out to the CMMI MIDS COR to move forward with their quality measure work.

            COR presents to the MIDS contractor
          </h3>
          The CMMI MIDS COR will forward the model team’s request to the CMMI MIDS contractor who will assess whether they can do the work and how much it will cost based on the request. If the work can be completed utilizing the existing CMMI MIDS contract, then the CMMI MIDS COR will modify the contract and add the new work to the MIDS contract.

            COR and model team takes information back to FO
          </h3>
          If the measure work cannot be completed under the existing CMMI MIDS contract, then the model teams would have to go back to the FO to request approval of funding to complete the work. If the FO approves the funding, then CMMI MIDS COR will complete a modification to the contract and once complete, instruct the CMMI MIDS contractor to begin working with the model team.

        The timing for using Shared Systems varies by model. It’s best to reach out during model design, so they know of upcoming work.

            Draft a Change Request (CR)
          </h3>
          <span>
            Donna will help you write a CR and submit it through Enterprise Electronic Change Information Management Portal (ECHIMP). CRs can occur up to 2-3 years before the changes get implemented. You may use the Fee For Service Change Request Resource Center for additional resources about drafting your CR.

There are two types of CRs:
          </span>
          <ul
            class="padding-left-4 margin-top-0"
          >
            <li
              class="list-item"
            >
              <span
                class="text-bold"
              >
                Analysis CR
              </span>
               - This type of CR is recommended for model teams still figuring out what to do for the model. Essentially, this is a request to talk and collaborate with the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) and Shared System Maintainers (SSM) on what will work for the model. It’s best to do an anaylsis CR a year before changes need made.
            </li>
            <li
              class="list-item"
            >

                class="text-bold"
              >
                Implementation CR
              </span>
               - This type of CR is for implementing the necessary changes to support the model. It’s best to submit these at least six months prior to needing the changes made.
