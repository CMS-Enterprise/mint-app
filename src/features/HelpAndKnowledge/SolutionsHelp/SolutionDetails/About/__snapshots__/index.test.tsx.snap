        The Accountable Care Organization – Operational System (ACO-OS) is the system of record for ACO and kidney models (which includes VT APM, ACO REACH, KCC, PCF) and the Medicare Shared Savings Program in CM. The system stores and exchanges ACO/entity demographic, provider, claim, and beneficiary data with ACOs/entities and CMS systems such as Master Data Management (MDM), Enterprise Data Lake (EDL), and Fee-for-Service (FFS) Shared System Maintainers (SSMs). The ACO-OS generates and shares the claims data each month for over 14,000,000 Medicare beneficiaries. The claims data and reports generated by ACO-OS are shared through the Data Hub feature in the 4i platform for CMMI models and ACO-Management System (ACO-MS) for Medicare Shared Savings Program.

        CPI Vetting is a process conducted by the Center for Program Integrity (CPI). Their mission is to detect and combat fraud, waste and abuse of the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

They make sure CMS is paying the right provider the right amount for services covered under their programs. They support proper enrollment and accurate billing practices by working with providers, states, and other stakeholders. They strive to protect patients while also minimizing unnecessary burden on providers.

CMMI works with CPI to screen participant and provider candidates prior to those candidates joining the model.

        </a>
         Suite of tools for non-ACO models; it enables CMMI-to-Participant Interoperability and application integration with other CMS systems. The Centralized Data Exchange (CDX) serves as an IT capability that enables the Innovation Center (IC) models to send and receive data with internal and external model participants using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). It provides an improved ability to send and receive ad hoc files with internal and external users that takes advantage of modern, cloud-based technologies with one centralized file exchange.

CDX is to exchange files between authorized users. This is implemented through the concept of a shared drive where authorized users can upload files and give access to those files to other authorized users. All users have a Home folder containing a list of all the files and folders to which they have access. The home folder is the Users "default/root" folder and contains all the files and folders to which the current user has access.

The business function of CDX is a centralized data exchange to enable interoperability and provide center-wide data collection capabilities across CMMI. The exchange solution supports sending the right data, at the right time, sending the right amount, and referencing the right participants.

          CCW provides researchers with Medicare and Medicaid beneficiary, claims, and assessment data linked by beneficiary across the continuum of care. In the past, researchers analyzing data files had to perform extensive analysis related to beneficiary matching, deduplication, and merging of the files in preparation for their study analysis. With the CCW data, this preliminary linkage work is already accomplished and delivered as part of the data files sent to researchers.

        GrantSolutions (GS) is a tool used to manage grants from funding opportunity planning, through the issuance of awards, to grant closeout.

CMS currently utilizes GrantSolutions primarily for awarding, managing, and closing out grants. For some grant programs, CMS utilizes the GS Application Review Module (ARM) for the required merit review of applications.

CMS also utilizes the GrantSolutions Recipient Insight (RI) tool which applies artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other emerging technologies to collect information from 750,000 organizations contained in seven different public databases. RI analyzes trends and identifies warning signs in the data. This data is presented through key data in actionable dashboards highlighting critical information for conducting risk assessment of applicants and recipients and identify reduce fraud, waste, and abuse.

        Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) is the single source of truth that centralizes and standardizes the federal financial accounting functions for all of CMS’s programs. All Medicare Fee For Service (FFS), Health Care Exchanges, Medicaid/CHIP/Grants, and Program Budget’s payments are accounted for and reported in HIGLAS.

Specific to CMMI, HIGLAS has two integrated points:

          CMMI uses an Innovation Payment Contractor (IPC) vendor – National Government Services (NGS) to make payments on many models such as QPP, CJR, MDPCP, CPC, etc. – all of the financial reporting and payment functions are in HIGLAS since Nov 2021.

        The Integrated Data Repository (IDR) is a multi-platform and high-volume data warehouse comprising integrated views of data across Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D, Beneficiary Entitlement, Enrollment and Utilization data. Provider reference information, Drug data, Contracts for Plans, and Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

The data in the IDR is leveraged by various components across the agency to facilitate investigative and litigious efforts focused on fighting Medicare and Medicaid fraud, waste and abuse. Users of the IDR leverage the robust suite of Enterprise BI tools made available to them to conduct in-depth analysis of risk adjustment policies, Medicare-Medicaid program comparisons, payment models, and prescription drug cost trends, among many other areas of importance.

        Master Data Management (MDM) at CMS produces integrated and harmonized Beneficiary and Provider data from various Medicare and Medicaid systems. To create this master version, MDM uses identity resolution to recognize distinct entities provider(e.g., a provider, beneficiary, organization, or program) by matching similar records across multiple data sets. MDM provides flexible and easy access to provider and beneficiary data through extracts, business intelligence reports and data lake mesh, and data share to IDRC Snowflake.

MDM is an authoritative System of Reference that integrates and stores data from CMS operational Systems of Record. MDM data is considered as authoritative as the data in the source System of Record from which it is obtained.

CMMI, in particular, uses MDM as a repository to store data to inform and resolve model overlaps (when necessary) for both aligned beneficiaries and participating providers among CMS payment models/demonstrations that are primarily shared savings-based models. This use of MDM for CMMI is a limited but critical role so that CMMI, CM, and Duals Office models have a single point of operational data ‘hub’ to resolve overlaps.

MDM is one of CMS’s Enterprise Shared Services (ESS) that provides authoritative data integrated and consolidated from various source systems. MDM helps address business challenges by linking data across multiple sources for various business needs. MDM provides:

        Master Data Management (MDM) for non-claims-based payments (NCBP) is a medium-term solution that satisfies the CMS requirement for payment models participating in shared savings initiatives to store non-claims payment data in a central location. Based on discussions with representatives of the Office of Information Technology (OIT), the Office of Enterprise Management (OEM), and the technical advisors of CMMI, MDM stores non-claims payment files in a central repository as CMS considers long-term solutions for non-claims payment data.

        CMMI awarded a task order off of CCSQ’s Quality Measure Development and Analytic Support (QMDAS) contract and titled the task order the Measure Instrument Development and Support contract, or MIDS for short. MIDS is a quality measure contract that supports model teams’ development of de novo measures and re-specification of existing measures for use in CMMI’s Alternative Payment Models (APMs). The MIDS contract is used to support measuring and incentivizing quality in the Center’s healthcare delivery models, assisting models in their quality strategy and design of measures.

        The Medicare Advantage (MA) & Prescription Drug (Part D) system maintains enrollment, payment, and premium data for Medicare beneficiary enrollments in Medicare Part C and D Plans. The Medicare Advantage (MA) & Prescription Drug (Part D) systems provide services to beneficiaries, Plans, and CMS.

Transaction Processing Plans submit batch files that contain enrollment, disenrollment, and various status update transactions to MARx. Using CMS business rules, MARx validates the transactions and accepts or rejects the submitted enrollments, disenrollment, or changes. Daily response files report the results of all transactions back to the plans. Other Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) systems also interact with MARx. Notifications from other systems, such as the Medicare Beneficiary Database (MBD), which report changes in beneficiary demographics, entitlement, health status, low-income subsidy status, etc. may affect beneficiary enrollment and payment to the Plans.

Payment Processing MARx calculates monthly Medicare payments for each Plan and generates payment adjustments when changes in membership and/or beneficiary health status occur. Monthly reports detail enrollment and payment information for the plans and CMS. Premium Processing MARx receives and processes transactions impacting Part C and Part D premiums, Medicare Part B Reduction, and Medicare Part C/D Plan enrollment status. Beneficiaries may elect to have their premiums withheld from their Social Security Administration (SSA) or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) checks. MARx is responsible for interfacing with SSA or RRB to establish or terminate withholding and tracks expected withholding amounts. Once the withholding agency completes processing each transaction, a response is sent back to MARx informing CMS of the withholding agency's acceptance or rejection of each of the individual premium withholding requests, cancellations, statuses, and amounts. The withholding agency's acceptance or rejection of the transactions is communicated to the Plans. The Premium Withhold Accounting functionality was implemented to reconcile the withheld premium amounts. Based on reconciliation of the expected and actual premium amounts, the premium dollars to be included in a plan's payment are determined.

        The Shared Systems are a group of systems used to process traditional Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) claims for Part A, Part B, and Durable Medical Equipment (DME).

Beneficiaries visit a provider of Medicare services, and that provider files a claim with their Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC). The MAC processes and pays the claim, and sends a remittance to advise the provider and a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) to the beneficiary. There are many Centers and Offices that receive the Medicare legislation that determines policies; those become change requests implemented through quarterly releases by the Shared System Maintainers (SSM) and the MACs.

        >
          Common Working File (CWF) is a Medicare Part A and B benefit coordination and claim validation system. CWF is a tool the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) uses to maintain records about beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare Fee-for-Service health plan. The CWF is comprised of nine localized databases called Hosts. Hosts maintain total Medicare claim history and entitlement information for the beneficiaries in their jurisdiction, which are updated daily by Medicare contractors and other applicable entities (i.e., Social Security Administration). CWF is used to determine the Medicare beneficiaries' eligibility for Medicare services and to monitor and inform other CMS payment systems on the appropriate usage of Medicare benefits, and to ensure payments for services received are appropriately determined and applied to payments based on Medicare payment and coverage rules. Also, the repository provides Medicare beneficiary eligibility information that is received nightly from the Social Security Administration (SSA). The eligibility information consists of newly enrolled beneficiaries in Medicare.

            The CWF provides the MAC with responses to claims. MACs also submit special transactions such as Medicare Secondary Payment (MSP) data (primary insurer data when Medicare is secondary), ESRD (End Stage Renal Disease) Method of Reimbursement Computation data (only Part A MACs submit these transactions), and Certificate of Medical Necessity ((CMS) only DME MACs submit these transactions). These transactions are submitted to the CWF along with the claims and are identified by transaction type. Claims are added to the CWF full claim history file.
