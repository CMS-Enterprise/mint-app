              The milestone table is the main model-to-operations matrix (MTO) content view in MINT. It is closely related to the solutions and IT systems table, since each one offers a slightly different view of content you have added to your MTO.

The other available risk indicators are “Some risk (off track)”, which is shown as a yellow triangle icon, and “Significantly at risk”, shown my a red circle icon.

                As described above, users can use the “Actions” column in the milestone table to edit the details of a milestone, including things like updating the status and risk indicator. Custom milestones may have additional editable fields, such as milestone title. Common milestones added from the milestone library have some details preset that cannot be edited.

This will default to “No risk (on track)” which shows no icon. The other available risk indicators are “Some risk (off track)”, which is shown as a yellow triangle icon, and “Significantly at risk”, shown my a red circle icon. IT Leads can select one of the three options from the edit panel.

                Categories and sub-categories are used to help group milestones within the MTO milestone table. IT Leads can add categories in a variety of different ways. Custom categories may be added from the table actions area. Users may also choose to add the template of standard categories, which can also be accessed from the table actions area. Users may also add a sub-category to a primary category by using the menu icon on the right side of any primary category row. Users may also choose to remove a category or sub-category using the menu on the right side of the category rows. Removing a category will not remove the milestones within it, any milestones in the removed category will become “Uncategorized”.

                  IT Leads and other users may reorder categories and sub-categories within the MTO by dragging and dropping them to other locations in the table. Users may also move a sub-category up and down within its primary category by using the menu icon on the right side of the sub-category row. Similarly, users may rearrange primary categories by using the menu icon on the right side of the primary category row and selecting the option labeled “Move category up” or “Move category down”.

                  The milestone library houses all of the common milestones contained in MINT. Common milestones are the milestones, activities, or functions that often appear in a model’s operational plan or Model-to-operations matrix (MTO). These common milestones are offered in MINT to give IT Leads a faster way to get started drafting a MTO for a new model and help us to understand which milestones are most frequently used by models.

                  The MINT solution library contains a variety of IT systems, contracts, CMS groups or teams, and other solutions often used to implement a model. While not comprehensive of all the possible solutions, the MINT solution library offers many that often appear in a model’s operational plan or Model-to-operations matrix (MTO). The solution library gives IT Leads a faster way to get started drafting a MTO for a new model and helps us to understand which solutions are most frequently used by models.

                  MINT encourages users to leverage the common milestones available in the milestone library, but the unique needs of individual models often necessitate the creation of custom milestones for a given model. IT Leads are able to create custom milestones directly from the Model-to-operations matrix (MTO) for their model.
