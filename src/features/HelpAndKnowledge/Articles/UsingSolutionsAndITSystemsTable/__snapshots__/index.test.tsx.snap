              The solutions and IT systems table is accessible from the tab bar below the model-to-operations matrix (MTO) header area and is one of the main MTO content views in MINT. It is closely related to the milestone table, since each one offers a slightly different view of content you have added to your MTO.

              There are a few ways to add a new solution to your MTO. IT Leads could navigate to the solution library and add common solutions from there. Users may also choose to add a custom solution, which can be done from the table actions area or from the solution library. Users may also add a solution by adding it to a milestone from the milestone table view of the MTO.
            </p>

              As described above, users can use the “Actions” column in the solution table to edit the details of a solution, including things like updating the status and risk indicator. Custom solutions may have additional editable fields, such as solution title. Common solutions added from the solution library have some details preset that cannot be edited.

                  In the confirmation screen, click the button labeled “Remove solution”. Doing so will remove this solution from your MTO completely, it you have added it to any milestones, it will no longer be associated with those milestones, and and all details about its status will be removed from your MTO. If you change your mind, you may click the X icon in the top right corner or click the button labeled “Go back” to close the pop-up without removing your milestone.

                  The milestone library houses all of the common milestones contained in MINT. Common milestones are the milestones, activities, or functions that often appear in a model’s operational plan or Model-to-operations matrix (MTO). These common milestones are offered in MINT to give IT Leads a faster way to get started drafting a MTO for a new model and help us to understand which milestones are most frequently used by models.

                  The MINT solution library contains a variety of IT systems, contracts, CMS groups or teams, and other solutions often used to implement a model. While not comprehensive of all the possible solutions, the MINT solution library offers many that often appear in a model’s operational plan or model-to-operations matrix (MTO). The solution library gives IT Leads a faster way to get started drafting a MTO for a new model and helps us to understand which solutions are most frequently used by models.

                  MINT encourages users to leverage the common milestones available in the milestone library, but the unique needs of individual models often necessitate the creation of custom milestones for a given model. Custom milestones and IT milestones allow IT Leads to identify and document system-specific milestones that align with the operational needs of the model. IT Leads can create these custom milestones directly within the model-to-Operations matrix (MTO) to ensure their model’s operational requirements are fully captured.
