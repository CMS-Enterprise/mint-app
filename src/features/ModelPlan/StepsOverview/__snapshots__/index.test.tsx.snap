                Fill out the sections of the Model Plan form and document model requirements
              </h3>
              <p>
                The Model Plan will help components across CMS evaluate your modelâ€™s operational requirements and IT needs. It contains questions about payments, providers, general characteristics, and more. The Model Plan is flexible, so you may leave questions blank, add new information, and change information as you iterate on your model or learn of new dependencies. The MINT model collaboration area and the Model Plan are cooperative spaces, allowing you to collaborate with the rest of your team to draft model requirements around participants, population, operations, payment options, and more.

              <p>
                Add additional details about your model by uploading or linking documents such as a concept paper, market research, policy paper, ICIP draft, or other related materials.

                Start your data exchange approach
              </h3>
              <p>
                Exchanging data between CMS and model participants is essential to model operations. After your 6-page concept paper is approved, work with your IT Lead (or reach out to the Business Services Group (BSG) if one still needs to be assigned) to determine how you'll exchange data so that we BSG and CMMI can help with new policy or technology opportunities. You should also include your data exchange approach in your ICIP.

                Work with your IT Lead to start your model-to-operations (MTO) matrix
              </h3>
              <p>
                Work with your IT Lead to determine milestones for your model and the solutions your model will use to implement those milestones. Your IT Lead will track the status of those milestones and solutions to stay organized throughout the process.

                Collaborate with your team and the cross-cutting groups at CMS to iterate on your model requirements. If you encounter any issues or have questions,
