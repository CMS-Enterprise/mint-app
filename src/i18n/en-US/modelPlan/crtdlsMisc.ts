MINT will automatically display ECHIMP information about CRs and TDLs associated with each model. It would be best if you worked with the Center for Medicare's Provider Billing Group (PBG) to create these. Note that the CR and TDL numbers are associated with your model to support PBG, OIT, the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), and Shared System Maintainers (SSMs) who implement these changes to the FFS payment systems.",
