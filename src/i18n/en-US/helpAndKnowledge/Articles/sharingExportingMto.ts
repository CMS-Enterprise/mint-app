    'Sharing your Model-to-operations matrix (MTO) with colleagues or other interested parties is easy in MINT. You may share your MTO (or a section of it) via email, you may export it as a PDF or CSV, and may also copy a link to the read view of your MTO in MINT. When you share your MTO via email, MINT will automatically send an email to your desired recipients which includes a link to the read view of your MTO in MINT. CMS staff who do not already have MINT access will be able to find instructions to get access to MINT, and those who do already have MINT access will be able to sign in to see your MTO.',
