    'The MINT solution library contains a variety of IT systems, contracts, CMS groups or teams, and other solutions often used to implement a model. While not comprehensive of all the possible solutions, the MINT solution library offers many that often appear in a model’s operational plan or model-to-operations matrix (MTO). The solution library gives IT Leads a faster way to get started drafting a MTO for a new model and helps us to understand which solutions are most frequently used by models.',
