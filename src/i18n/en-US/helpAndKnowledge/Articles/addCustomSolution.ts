    'When possible, MINT encourages users to add solutions to a Model-to-operations matrix (MTO) via the solution library. However, MINTâ€™s solution library does not currently offer a comprehensive list of all IT systems, contracts, and other operational solutions used for models. because of this and the unique needs of individual models, IT Leads may need to create custom solutions for a given model. IT Leads are able to create custom solutions directly from the Model-to-operations matrix (MTO) for their model.'
