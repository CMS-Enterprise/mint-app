  whatIsMTO: 'What is an MTO?',
  whatIsMTODescription:
    'The Model-to-operations matrix is the main IT lead deliverable. It is usually started as soon as an IT lead is assigned to a model, shortly before model clearance, when model intake (and the model’s MINT Model Plan) are significantly completed and the model has a good chance of being cleared. A solid draft of an MTO is usually expected within 20 days of beginning to engage with a model team, though IT leads should expect to continue updating the MTO and its statuses as work on the operational aspects of the model progresses. The Model-to-operations matrix documents a list of functions or milestones that a model needs to accomplish in order to go live and be successful, the IT systems or solutions used to implement those milestones, and when work for individual milestones must be completed by.',
  whyCreateMTO: 'Why create an MTO?',
  whyCreateMTODescription:
    'MTOs help to make sense of and document the very complex set of systems, contracts, and activities used to implement a model. It helps keep track of the status of a variety of moving parts, and allows all interested parties to stay informed about model implementation progress. In the past, MTOs have been maintained by individual IT Leads as Powerpoint or Excel files, but MINT allows for more streamlined setup and update capabilities for IT Leads, as well as improved self-service access for all other interested parties.',
