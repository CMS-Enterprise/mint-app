  While it is fine to use pipeline support for 2-page and 6-page concept paper work and for developing Innovation Center Investment Proposal (ICIP) content, after the ICIP clears, model teams can no longer use pipeline funding. It can take a few months to get implementation contractor support, so plan accordingly.

        'Before the meeting, attach your 6-page concept paper to the calendar invite for your meeting with CMMI FO. We also recommend uploading your concept paper to your model collaboration area within MINT. This will allow other CMS staff involved in the model development process to begin preparing as early as possible for their work with your model team.',
        'Come prepared to discuss your model concept with the CMMI FO and receive feedback.',
        'If you think you’ll need a pipeline contractor, and haven’t already spoken to CMMI FO about this, definitely flag this during the meeting. As mentioned above, they will need to approve the request.',
        'If CMMI FO has not requested many revisions to the 6-page concept paper and approves the forward progress, it might be a good to have thought through a general mock up of a timeframe with proposed approximate dates for ICIP draft, potential clearance, etc.'

        '<bold>Continue iterating:</bold> CMMI FO may have suggestions for the team to iterate on. In this case, model teams may be asked to come back for another 6-page concept review after they’ve had time to ideate and address their considerations. Some concepts require multiple rounds of iteration, so model teams shouldn’t be discouraged if their concept isn’t approved the first time around.',
        '<bold>Approval:</bold> If during the meeting CMMI FO decides the model concept is feasible, they will approve the 6-page concept paper and it will move on to review by the Office of the Administrator. Model teams will then continue to refine and solidify aspects of their model and can start writing their ICIP. As they work through and refine the details of their model, model teams will continue to update their Model Plan within MINT. If they haven’t already started filling out a Model Plan within MINT, this is often a great time to start that. Many of the details that will go into a 6-page concept paper are also asked within the Model Plan. A Model Plan in MINT is a useful way to help communicate concepts and implementation details with other groups across CMS who assist with various aspects of development and implementation of models.',
        '<bold>Not approved:</bold> If CMMI FO determines the concept isn’t a path they’re comfortable exploring, the concept may be shelved. When this happens, concepts may be saved for future development.'
