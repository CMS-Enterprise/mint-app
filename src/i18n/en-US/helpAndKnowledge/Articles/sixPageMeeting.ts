  While it is fine to use pipeline support for 2-page and 6-page concept paper work and for developing Innovation Center Investment Proposal (ICIP) content, after the ICIP clears, model teams can no longer use pipeline funding. It can take a few months to get implementation contractor support, so plan accordingly. Model teams should work with the Division of Central Contracts Services (DCCS), the Division of Systems Support, Operation & Security (DSSOS), and the Office of Acquisition and Grants Management (OAGM) for assistance with contracting needs.`
