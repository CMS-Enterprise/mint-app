By this point, many of the details of a model concept are beginning to take shape. The operational details in a 6-page concept paper are also captured within the Model Plan in order to better offer a single source of truth for other CMS partners working with model teams to develop and operationalize models. Additionally, model teams will be working with various cross-cutting groups as they plan and refine their model, so it will be helpful to everyone involved if model teams keep their MINT Model Plans up-to-date as they iterate and refine their model.',

      'While it is fine to use pipeline support for 2-pager and 6-pager work and for developing ICIP content, after the ICIP clears, model teams can no longer use pipeline funding. It can take a few months to get implementation contractor support, so plan accordingly. Model teams should work with the Division of Central Contracts Services (DCCS), the Division of Systems Support, Operation & Security (DSSOS), and the Office of Acquisition and Grants Management (OAGM) for assistance with contracting needs.'

In this case, model teams may be asked to come back for another 6-pager review after they’ve had time to ideate and address their considerations. Some concepts require multiple rounds of iteration, so don’t be discouraged if your concept isn’t approved the first time around. Additionally, if CMMI FO determines the concept isn’t a path they’re comfortable exploring, the concept may be shelved.',
