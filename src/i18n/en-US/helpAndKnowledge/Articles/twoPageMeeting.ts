It’s important to note, model teams need to get approval from CMMI FO to utilize one of these contractors.',

Some concepts require multiple rounds of iteration, so don’t be discouraged if your concept isn’t approved the first time around.',

Many of the details that will go into the 6-pager concept paper are a part of the Model Plan.'
