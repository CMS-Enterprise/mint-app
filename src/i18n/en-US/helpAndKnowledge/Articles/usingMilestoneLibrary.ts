    'The milestone library houses all of the common milestones contained in MINT. Common milestones are the milestones, activities, or functions that often appear in a modelâ€™s operational plan or Model-to-operations matrix (MTO). These common milestones are offered in MINT to give IT Leads a faster way to get started drafting a MTO for a new model and help us to understand which milestones are most frequently used by models.'
