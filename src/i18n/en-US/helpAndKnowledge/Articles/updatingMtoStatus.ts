    'The MINT Model-to-operations matrix (MTO) has 3 main overall statuses: Ready to start, In progress, and Ready for review. Ready to start is automatically set when a MTO is completely empty of all content. In progress is automatically set when any content (milestones, categories, solutions, and/or templates) are added to the MTO. Ready for review can be manually set when the contents of an MTO are fairly well set and the IT Lead is ready for comments and feedback from others. Follow the instructions below to set the status for your MTO to Ready for review.'
