    'Exchanging data with our participants is an essential component of model operations. We collect data across a few use cases such as quality and clinical reporting. We also share data back with participants to provide tools and information to enable model success (e.g., analytics or claims data). The following is a framework for evaluating the data exchange components of new models in the context of new policy or technology opportunities.',
  alert:
    'We recommend thinking about how data will be exchanged early in the model design process. These considerations should also be mentioned in your 2-page concept paper.',
