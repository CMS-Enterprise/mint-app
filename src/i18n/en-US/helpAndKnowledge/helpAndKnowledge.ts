It provides an improved ability to send and receive ad hoc files with internal and external users that takes advantage of modern, cloud-based technologies with one centralized file exchange.

CDX is to exchange files between authorized users. This is implemented through the concept of a shared drive where authorized users can upload files and give access to those files to other authorized users. All users have a Home folder containing a list of all the files and folders to which they have access. The home folder is the Users "default/root" folder and contains all the files and folders to which the current user has access.

The business function of CDX is a centralized data exchange to enable interoperability and provide center-wide data collection capabilities across CMMI. The exchange solution supports sending the right data, at the right time, sending the right amount, and referencing the right participants.`,

      description: `Master Data Management (MDM) at CMS produces integrated and harmonized Beneficiary and Provider data from various Medicare and Medicaid systems. To create this master version, MDM uses identity resolution to recognize distinct entities provider(e.g., a provider, beneficiary, organization, or program) by matching similar records across multiple data sets. MDM provides flexible and easy access to provider and beneficiary data through extracts, business intelligence reports and data lake mesh, and data share to IDRC Snowflake.

MDM is an authoritative System of Reference that integrates and stores data from CMS operational Systems of Record. MDM data is considered as authoritative as the data in the source System of Record from which it is obtained.

CMMI, in particular, uses MDM as a repository to store data to inform and resolve model overlaps (when necessary) for both aligned beneficiaries and participating providers among CMS payment models/demonstrations that are primarily shared savings-based models. This use of MDM for CMMI is a limited but critical role so that CMMI, CM, and Duals Office models have a single point of operational data ‘hub’ to resolve overlaps.

The Medicare Advantage (MA) & Prescription Drug (Part D) systems provide services to beneficiaries, Plans, and CMS.

Transaction Processing Plans submit batch files that contain enrollment, disenrollment, and various status update transactions to MARx. Using CMS business rules, MARx validates the transactions and accepts or rejects the submitted enrollments, disenrollment, or changes. Daily response files report the results of all transactions back to the plans. Other Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) systems also interact with MARx. Notifications from other systems, such as the Medicare Beneficiary Database (MBD), which report changes in beneficiary demographics, entitlement, health status, low-income subsidy status, etc. may affect beneficiary enrollment and payment to the Plans.

Payment Processing MARx calculates monthly Medicare payments for each Plan and generates payment adjustments when changes in membership and/or beneficiary health status occur. Monthly reports detail enrollment and payment information for the plans and CMS. Premium Processing MARx receives and processes transactions impacting Part C and Part D premiums, Medicare Part B Reduction, and Medicare Part C/D Plan enrollment status. Beneficiaries may elect to have their premiums withheld from their Social Security Administration (SSA) or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) checks. MARx is responsible for interfacing with SSA or RRB to establish or terminate withholding and tracks expected withholding amounts. Once the withholding agency completes processing each transaction, a response is sent back to MARx informing CMS of the withholding agency's acceptance or rejection of each of the individual premium withholding requests, cancellations, statuses, and amounts. The withholding agency's acceptance or rejection of the transactions is communicated to the Plans. The Premium Withhold Accounting functionality was implemented to reconcile the withheld premium amounts. Based on reconciliation of the expected and actual premium amounts, the premium dollars to be included in a plan's payment are determined. `,
