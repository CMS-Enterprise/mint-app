It provides an improved ability to send and receive ad hoc files with internal and external users that takes advantage of modern, cloud-based technologies with one, centralized file exchange.

    CDX is to exchange files between authorized users. This is implemented through the concept of a shared drive where authorized users can upload files and give access to those files to other authorized users. All users have a Home folder containing a list of all the files and folders to which they have access. The home folder is the Users "default/root" folder and contains all the files and folders to which the current user has access.
    
    The business function of CDX is a centralized data exchange to enable interoperability and provide center-wide data collection capabilities across CMMI. The exchange solution supports sending the right data, at the right time, sending the right amount, and referencing the right participants.`

MDM provides flexible and easy access to provider and beneficiary data through extracts, web services, and APIs.

    MDM is an authoritative System of Reference that integrates and stores data from CMS operational Systems of Record. MDM data is considered as authoritative as the data in the source System of Record from which it is obtained.
    
    CMMI, in particular, uses MDM as a repository to store data to inform and resolve model overlaps (when necessary) for both aligned beneficiaries and participating providers among CMS payment models/demonstrations that are primarily shared savings-based models. This use of MDM for CMMI is a limited but critical role so that CMMI, CM, and Duals Office models have a single point of operational data ‘hub’ to resolve overlaps.
    
    MDM is one of CMS’s Enterprise Shared Services (ESS) that provides authoritative data integrated and consolidated from various source systems. MDM helps address business challenges by linking data across multiple sources for various business needs. MDM provides:
    Trusted identity resolution capability for CMS’ expanding catalog of Master Data sources
    Integration and consolidation of Master Data from numerous disparate data sources to create a consolidated, authoritative view of each entity
    Flexible and easy access to Master Data (e.g., near real-time web services, extracts for batch processing, APIs, and analytic capabilities).

The Medicare Advantage (MA) & Prescription Drug (Part D) systems provide services to beneficiaries, Plans, and CMS. 

    Transaction Processing Plans submit batch files that contain enrollment, disenrollment, and various status update transactions to MARx. Using CMS business rules, MARx validates the transactions and accepts or rejects the submitted enrollments, disenrollment, or changes. Daily response files report the results of all transactions back to the plans. Other Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) systems also interact with MARx. Notifications from other systems, such as the Medicare Beneficiary Database (MBD), which report changes in beneficiary demographics, entitlement, health status, low-income subsidy status, etc. may affect beneficiary enrollment and payment to the Plans. 
    
    Payment Processing MARx calculates monthly Medicare payments for each Plan and generates payment adjustments when changes in membership and/or beneficiary health status occur. Monthly reports detail enrollment and payment information for the plans and CMS. Premium Processing MARx receives and processes transactions impacting Part C and Part D premiums, Medicare Part B Reduction, and Medicare Part C/D Plan enrollment status. Beneficiaries may elect to have their premiums withheld from their Social Security Administration (SSA) or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) checks. MARx is responsible for interfacing with SSA or RRB to establish or terminate withholding and tracks expected withholding amounts. Once the withholding agency completes processing each transaction, a response is sent back to MARx informing CMS of the withholding agency's acceptance or rejection of each of the individual premium withholding requests, cancellations, statuses, and amounts. The withholding agency's acceptance or rejection of the transactions is communicated to the Plans. The Premium Withhold Accounting functionality was implemented to reconcile the withheld premium amounts. Based on reconciliation of the expected and actual premium amounts, the premium dollars to be included in a plan's payment are determined. 
    
    User Interface 
    The MARx application includes online processing capabilities. The MARx User Interface (UI) provides Plans and CMS the ability to view and update beneficiary, enrollment, payment, and premium information. `
