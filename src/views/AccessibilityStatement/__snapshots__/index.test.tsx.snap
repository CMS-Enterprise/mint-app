      CMS accessible communications

    <p>
      CMS provides free auxiliary aids and services including information in accessible formats like Braille, large print, data/audio files, relay services and TTY communications. If you request information in an accessible format from CMS, you won’t be disadvantaged by any additional time necessary to provide it. This means you will get extra time to take any action if there’s a delay in fulfilling your request.
